\begin{problem}
Given a set of data points $x_1,\ldots,x_n$, we can define the convex hull to be the set of all points $x$ given by

\[x = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i x_i \]

\noindent
where $\alpha_{i} \geq 0$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i = 1$. Consider a second set of points $z_1,\ldots,z_n$ together with their corresponding convex hull. By definition, the two sets of points will be linearly separable if there exists a vector $w$ and a scalar $b$ such that $w^{T}x_i + b > 0$ for all $x_i$ and $w^{T}z_i + b < 0$ for all $z_i$.

Prove that the two sets of points are linearly separable if their convex hulls do not intersect.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  \textit{By contradiction}.

  Assume that $z$ and $x$ do not intersect but are \textit{not} linearly separable.  By the definition of a convex hull, the boundaries of the areas enclosed by $x$ and $z$ are continuous polytopes.  If $x$ and $z$ are not linearly separable then for all $w$, including those meeting the definition of $\alpha$, there exists some $x_j \in x$ and $z_k \in z$ such that:

  \[w^{T}x_j + b = w^{T}z_k +b \text{.} \]

\noindent
By subtracting $b$, it is clear then that:

\[w^{T}x_j  = w^{T}z_k \text{.} \]

\noindent
Therefore, $x_j = z_k$ which means $x_j\in z$ and $z_k \in x$.  However, this is a contradiction since $x$ and $z$ do not intersect, i.e.,~are disjoint.

\end{proof}
