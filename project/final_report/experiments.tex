\subsection{}

Decision boundary margin is a common metric for measuring the quality of a binary classification algorithm. Example~$\xBase$ is labeled positive when ${\pHatDist<\nHatDist}$; otherwise $\xBase$~is labeled negative. Figure~\ref{fig:Experiments:UnlabelPlot} displays the positive and negative decoder losses for the MNIST experiment in Table~\ref{}.

Each mark in the graph represents a single training example where the shape and color indicate the mark's actual label and whether the example was in $\Pos$ or~$\Unlabel$. $\pHatDist$ is the $x$-axis while $\nHatDist$ is the $y$-axis. The decision boundary where ${\pHatDist=\nHatDist}$ is represented by the gray dashed line.  As previous described, the predicted label of any point of above this positive while those examples below the line are predicted negative.

Ideally, all positive-valued examples (shown as \red{XXXX}) would be in the upper left corner of the figure ---~${\pHatDist\ll\nHatDist}$~--- while negative-value examples would be in the lower right corner ---~${\pHatDist\gg\nHatDist}$.
