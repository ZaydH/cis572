\section{Future Work}

While the experimental results are promising, significant work remains for this project.

One question asked after the in-class presentation focused on whether additional datasets may be considered.  In response, we implemented support for \CIFARten.  However, initial results are poor and do not merit reporting; we further expect CIFAR-10 images will require convolutional layers for optimal performance.  The current timeline for initial \CIFARten\ results is the end of June.  Both the accuracy and AUC results are expected to be substantially worse for \CIFARten.
